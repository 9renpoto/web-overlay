# Overview

*Web-Overlay* is an experimental toolkit for constructing Web-based
overlay networks, where each node (peer) is either a Web browser or a
Node.js.  WebRTC and WebSocket (actually
[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)) connections are used as an
interconnect between nodes.

Web-Overlay includes implementation of *Connection Manager* and
a structured overlay network, *Kirin*.

Web-Overlay is developed by Abe Lab at Osaka City University, Japan
